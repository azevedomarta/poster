            <p class="quote">"By digital colonialism we understand the <span class="imp">deployment of imperial power in the form of new rules, designs, languages, cultures and belief systems serving the interests of the dominant power</span>. (...) By collecting personal and transactional data on a scale unprecedented in human history, a few corporate actors have the power to shape society."</p>

            <p class="quote">"Common to both traditional and algorithmic colonialism is the desire to dominate, monitor, and inﬂuence social, political, and cultural discourse through the control of core communication and infrastructure mediums. While traditional colonialism is often spearheaded by political and government forces,<span class="imp"> digital colonialism is driven by corporate tech monopolies – both of which are in search of wealth accumulation."</span>  </p>
